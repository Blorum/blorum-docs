# Documents - Reserved data

Blorum often use id=0 columns as reserved data, for example, a comment in reply to cid 0 will be considered as a first-level comment, for another example, a user invited by uid=0 user is considered to have their account created by themselves.


The uid=1 will by default the omni user, however, omni user could still grant others omni role(and also removing), thus, if you granted your friend omni, they can remove your omni role.
